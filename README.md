## Introduction
The Fisher's Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of data analytics and machine learning. It consists of 150 instances of iris flowers, with each instance having measurements of four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is commonly used for classification tasks, such as predicting the species of iris flower based on the four measurements. The three species in the dataset are setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The dataset is widely used for exploring machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, and data visualization techniques.

*Libraries used*:
Numpy is used for performing mathematical operations and handling large arrays and matrices efficiently.

The Seaborn library focuses on data visualization. It extends the functionality of matplotlib and produces more visually appealing and informative plots.

Matplotlib.pyplot is a plotting library used to create static and interactive visualizations in Python.

Pandas is a library used for data manipulation and analysis - it provides data structures for efficiently storing and processing large datasets.

Scipy.stats provides functions for statistical analysis, including the shapiro, normaltest and norm functions used in this project.
