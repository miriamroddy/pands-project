## Introduction
The Iris dataset is a commonly used dataset within machine learning and pattern recognition fields. It was introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936 as part of his research on multivariate statistics. The dataset consists of 150 observations of iris flowers, each with four measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The dataset is useful when exploring different machine learning algorithms, as it provides a means of comparing and evaluating the performance of different models. A task frequently cited in the literature is one that classifies the observations into one of three species of iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. The dataset is often used to assess the performace of different classification algorithms, including decision trees, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks.

A strength of the dataset is that it is well-balanced, with an equal number of observations for each of the three species. Since the dataset is well-balanced, it reduces the risk of bias towards one particular class. Additionally, the dataset is relatively small, which makes it easy to work with and analyse. In this project, I will use several Python libraries to investigate the dataset. I will start by assessing whether parametric or non-parametric methods are more suitable, then explore the data with various visualization techniques. I'll then briefly look at the dataset in the context of machine learning.

**Libraries used**:

[*NumPy*](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_intro.asp) is used for performing mathematical operations and handling large arrays and matrices efficiently.  It is widely used in data analysis and machine learning applications.

The [*seaborn*](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) library focuses on data visualization. It extends the functionality of matplotlib and produces more visually appealing and informative plots. Seaborn includes functions for making many common types of plots, such as scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps.

[*Matplotlib.pyplot*](https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_pyplot.asp) Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python. pyplot is a sub-library of Matplotlib that provides an  interface for creating figures, subplots, and other types of plots, such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and histograms.

[*Pandas*](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp) is primarily used for data manipulation and analysis - it provides data structures for efficiently storing and processing large datasets. It is built on top of NumPy and provides additional functionality for working with structured data, including tools for reading and writing data to and from various file formats, data cleaning and transformation, and data analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
 
The aim of exporatory data analysis is to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights into the datasat, which will then help us to decide which methods to use for subsequent stages. For the Iris dataset specifically, we had the option of assuming that the data was [well balanced](https://towardsdatascience.com/eda-of-the-iris-dataset-190f6dfd946d#:~:text=The%20dataset%20is%20balanced%20i.e.,petal%20width%20and%20petal%20length), normally distributed and doesn't need much in the way of data-cleaning. It is, after all, the "Hello World" of Data Science, and wouldn't be such a commonly cited exemplar if it contained lots of messy data. However, we won't learn a whole lot from that, nor is it ever good practice to merely assume - we might even find out something interesting.

I decided to combine elements of exploratory data analysis and preliminary statistical analysis in my text file, descriptive_stats.txt. I decided to examine:

Dataset Structure - The pandas [info() method](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/ref_df_info.asp#:~:text=The%20info()%20method%20prints,method%20actually%20prints%20the%20info) outputs a summary of the dataset's structure to our descriptive_stats.txt file. It includes information about the numbers of rows and columns, data types and size of the dataset in KB. In a real-world scenario, this would be a useful step in documenting and sharing information with colleagues or other collaborators. If I was developing this project further, I would extract information from this basic output and format it in a way that would be more meaningful to the layman (since we were tasked with explaining the dataset to colleagues, who may not necessarily have much technical knowledge).

We start using the [info()](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.info.html) method - this provides information about the dataset, including the number of rows, columns, column names, data types, and memory usage:
```
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 150 entries, 0 to 149
Data columns (total 5 columns):
 #   Column        Non-Null Count  Dtype  
---  ------        --------------  -----  
 0   sepal_length  150 non-null    float64
 1   sepal_width   150 non-null    float64
 2   petal_length  150 non-null    float64
 3   petal_width   150 non-null    float64
 4   species       150 non-null    object 
dtypes: float64(4), object(1)
memory usage: 6.0+ KB
```
The dataset contains a total of 150 samples with an equal number of samples for each species of Iris. 

Missing Values - When conducting research, is it vital to acknowledge and address missing values so that we can be confident about the validity and reliability of our analyses. We do this using the [.isnull](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.isnull.html) object. As we can see from the output, the dataset thankfully doesn't contain any missing values:

```
Missing Values:
No
```
We also want to check for duplicates. We do this by using [.duplicated().sum()]{https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-pandas-duplicated-drop-duplicates/}. We see that there are three duplicated rows. This obviously has to be assessed in context. In some datasets, duplicates will highlight information that has been included twice in error. In others however, they may merely highlight several distinct observations that have identical measurements. We can assume that this is the case here - if one takes sufficient samples from a population, one would expect to find this and therefore we don't need to conduct any data cleansing.

Duplicates -
```
Duplicates:
3 duplicates found.

Duplicated Lines:
     sepal_length  sepal_width  petal_length  petal_width    species
34            4.9          3.1           1.5          0.1     setosa
37            4.9          3.1           1.5          0.1     setosa
142           5.8          2.7           5.1          1.9  virginica
```
Descriptive Statistics - I will discusss this further in the Statistical Analysis section.

Potential Outliers using Z-scores - A z-score is a commonly used statistical measurement which gives us information about the relative position of a data point within a dataset. A threshold of 3 is [commonly used](https://towardsdatascience.com/outlier-detection-part1-821d714524c) within data science, so I decided to go with this. We see that one set of observations is above this threshold - this gives us a little more information about what to narrow in on when we begin our data vizualisation stage.
```
        sepal_length  sepal_width  petal_length  petal_width    species
15           5.7          4.4           1.5          0.4        setosa
```
D'Agostino-Pearson Test -  This is a statistical test used to assess whether a dataset follows a normal distribution. It is based on the skewness and kurtosis of the data. It's important to conduct this analysis for each variable, and then for each variable divided by species. The reason for this is that we might find that the data is not normally distributed when assessed as a whole but the underlying reason here is that we are looking at different populations. We have a strong theoretical basis to assume that this will be the case here, since we are looking at members of three species of iris. We are using the [scipy.stats.normaltest](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.normaltest.html) function to do this.

```
D'Agostino-Pearson Test:

   sepal_length  sepal_width  petal_length  petal_width
0          5.74         3.58        221.33       136.78
1          0.06         0.17          0.00         0.00

D'Agostino-Pearson Test by Species:

              sepal_length  sepal_width  petal_length  petal_width
species

virginica  0          0.21         2.57          2.70         1.24

```
Shapiro-Wilk Test - This is another test that looks for normality given a given distribution. It is based on the comparison between the observed data and the expected values under the assumption of normality. Again, because we know we are looking at different species of plants, we want to look at these figures per variable and then divided by species. We implement this by using the [scipy.stats.shapiro](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.shapiro.html) function.
```
Shapiro-Wilk Test:

   sepal_length  sepal_width  petal_length  petal_width
0          0.98         0.98          0.88          0.9
1          0.01         0.08          0.00          0.0

Shapiro-Wilk Test by Species:

              sepal_length  sepal_width  petal_length  petal_width
species                                                           
setosa     0          0.98         0.97          0.95         0.81
           1          0.46         0.20          0.05         0.00
versicolor 0          0.98         0.97          0.97         0.95
           1          0.46         0.34          0.16         0.03
virginica  0          0.97         0.97          0.96         0.96
           1          0.26         0.18          0.11         0.09
```
For both the Shapiro-Wilk and the D'Agostino-Pearson tests, we want to look at the p-values in both tables (row 1). If the p-value is greater than the chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), it suggests that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis of normality. In this case, we can consider the distribution for that species and feature to be approximately normal, once they have been divided by species. 

It's important to note that the data doesn't appear normally distributed if you look at the dataset as a whole, but as mentioned previously, this is because we are looking at 3 different populations together and it makes a lot more sense to examine them when divided by species.
--------
## Data Visualization

This stage involves using various visualization techniques to examine the data.
### Boxplots
Each attribute in the dataset can be visualized on a boxplot. I used seaborn's [boxplot()](https://pythonbasics.org/seaborn-boxplot/) method.  The box in the middle of the plot represents the interquartile range (IQR), which is the range between the 25th and 75th percentiles of the data. The line inside the box represents the median value of the data. The whiskers extending from the box represent the range of values that fall within 1.5 times the IQR. Any points outside this range are considered outliers and are plotted as individual points.
![Boxplot - Petal Length](https://github.com/miriamroddy/pands-project/blob/main/Boxplot_Petal_Length.png)
We see a clear distinction here between Iris setosa and the other two species, as Iris setosa has significantly shorter petal length compared to Iris versicolor and Iris virginica.
There are no outliers in petal length for any of the species, implying relatively consistent values within each group.
![Boxplot - Petal Width](https://github.com/miriamroddy/pands-project/blob/main/Boxplot_Petal_Width.png)
The boxplots demonstrate that the petal width tends to be smallest for Iris setosa, wider for Iris versicolor, and widest for Iris virginica.
There are a few outliers in petal width for both Iris versicolor and Iris virginica, indicating some variation in these species.
![Boxplot - Sepal Length](https://github.com/miriamroddy/pands-project/blob/main/Boxplot_Sepal_Length.png)
The boxplots indicate that the sepal length tends to be shortest for Iris setosa, longer for Iris versicolor, and longest for Iris virginica.
There are no significant outliers for sepal length in any of the species.
![Boxplot - Sepal Width](https://github.com/miriamroddy/pands-project/blob/main/Boxplot_Sepal_Width.png)
The boxplots suggest that the sepal width is generally narrower for Iris setosa, slightly wider for Iris versicolor, and widest for Iris virginica.
There are a few outliers in the sepal width for Iris setosa. Having no qualifications in botany, I can only speculate here but this may becan indication of some variability within species or it may be the result of measurement errors.
### Histograms
I chose to apply a kernel density [KDE](https://likegeeks.com/seaborn-histplot/#histogram_with_KDE) estimate to smooth the distribution and show on the plot as a line that follows the distribution. We can examine this and compare it to the normal distribution.
![Histogram - Petal Length](https://github.com/miriamroddy/pands-project/blob/main/histogram_petal_length.png)
We are using Seaborn's [hisplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.histplot.html) function for this. The histogram of petal length exhibits a bimodal distribution, indicating the presence of two distinct groups. One mode is centered around 1.0 to 2.0 centimeters, representing Iris setosa, while the other mode is centered around 4.0 to 6.0 centimeters, representing Iris versicolor and Iris virginica.
![Histogram - Petal Width](https://github.com/miriamroddy/pands-project/blob/main/histogram_petal_width.png)
The histogram of petal width shows a unimodal distribution with a peak around 0.2 to 0.4 centimeters.
There is a slight skewness towards higher values, indicating a few wider petal widths compared to the majority of the data.
![Histogram - Sepal Length](https://github.com/miriamroddy/pands-project/blob/main/histogram_sepal_length.png)
The histogram of sepal length suggests that it follows a somewhat normal distribution, with a peak around 5.0 to 6.0 centimeters.
There is a slight skewness towards higher values, indicating a few longer sepal lengths compared to the majority of the data.
![Histogram - Sepal Width](https://github.com/miriamroddy/pands-project/blob/main/histogram_sepal_width.png)
The histogram of sepal width reveals a somewhat normal distribution, with a peak around 3.0 to 3.5 centimeters.
There is a slight skewness towards lower values, suggesting a few narrower sepal widths compared to the majority of the data.
### Overlapping Histogram
![Histogram - Overlapping](https://github.com/miriamroddy/pands-project/blob/main/overlappinghistograms.png)
In an overlapping histogram where the variables are divided by species, we can gain further insights into the data than we have found in the previous histograms.
Regarding sepal length, the overlapping histogram shows that Iris setosa generally has shorter sepal lengths compared to Iris versicolor and Iris virginica.
There is some overlap between the distributions of sepal lengths for Iris versicolor and Iris virginica, with Iris virginica tending to have slightly longer sepal lengths overall.
With regard to sepal width, the overlapping histogram indicates that there is some overlap between the sepal width distributions of the three species.
However, Iris setosa tends to have slightly narrower sepal widths compared to Iris versicolor and Iris virginica, while the latter two species exhibit relatively similar distributions.When we look at petal length, we see that Iris setosa has significantly shorter petal lengths compared to Iris versicolor and Iris virginica.
There is minimal overlap between the distributions of petal lengths for Iris setosa and the other two species, while there is some overlap between Iris versicolor and Iris virginica.
When looking at petal width, we find that Iris setosa generally has much narrower petal widths compared to Iris versicolor and Iris virginica.
The distributions of petal widths for Iris versicolor and Iris virginica show some overlap, with Iris virginica having slightly wider petal widths on average.

### Scatterplots
![Scatterplot - Petal Length and Width](https://github.com/miriamroddy/pands-project/blob/main/Scatterplot_Petal.png)
This scatterplot reveals a positive correlation between petal length and width, indicating that as petal length increases, petal width tends to increase as well. This type of representation assists in distinguishing between different species - we can see the species as distinct clusters form based on their petal measurements. Additionally, the scatterplot allows for the identification of outliers, further adding to what we saw when looking at boxplots.
![Scatterplot - Sepal Length and Width](https://github.com/miriamroddy/pands-project/blob/main/Scatterplot_Sepal.png)
Like in the praveious scatterplot, we see evidence of distinct clusters here, suggesting the presence of different species within the dataset. There appears to be a positive correlation between sepal length and width, indicating that as sepal length increases, sepal width tends to increase as well. However, there are a few outliers that deviate significantly from the general pattern. This reinforces what we saw when looking at the boxplots. 
### Pairplot
![Pairplot](https://github.com/miriamroddy/pands-project/blob/main/pairplot.png)
This pairplot shows further evidence of clusters within the data - specifically that setosa has a very distinct cluster, and that virginina and versicolour also form unique clusters, albeit clusters that are closer together than they are to setosa.
### Heatmap
![Heatmap](https://github.com/miriamroddy/pands-project/blob/main/heatmap.png)
The [heatmap](https://pythonbasics.org/seaborn-heatmap/) provides more evidence of a strong positive correlation between petal length and petal width, indicating that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well. Additionally, a moderate positive correlation is observed between sepal length and sepal width. These findings emphasize the relationships between our variables, providing insights into the dataset's structure.

## Statistical Analysis
From the table below, we see that the mean sepal length was 5.84 cm, while the mean sepal width was 3.05 cm. The mean petal length was 3.76 cm, and the mean petal width was 1.20 cm:
```
Descriptive Statistics:

max            7.90         4.40          6.90         2.50

```
It is also important that we look at these figures divided by species - if we examine the mean and SD of the flowers as a whole, we are losing a lot of important information. Using this code: 
```
f.write(str(Irisdata.groupby('species').describe().round(2)))
```
I grouped the observations by species and we see the following output:
```
           sepal_length                                      
                  count  mean   std  min   25%  50%  75%  max
species                                                       
setosa             50.0  5.01  0.35  4.3  4.80  5.0  5.2  5.8
versicolor         50.0  5.94  0.52  4.9  5.60  5.9  6.3  7.0
virginica          50.0  6.59  0.64  4.9  6.22  6.5  6.9  7.9

```
Iris sepals vary among the iris species, with setosa having the shortest sepals and virginica having the longest.
```
           sepal_width

virginica         50.0  2.97  0.32  2.2  2.80  3.0  3.18  3.8
```
Setosa generally have wider sepals compared to versicolor and virginica.
```
           petal_length

versicolor        50.0  4.26  0.47  3.0  4.0  4.35  4.60  5.1
virginica         50.0  5.55  0.55  4.5  5.1  5.55  5.88  6.9
```
Setosas appear to have the shortest petals, while virginica iris flowers have the longest petals among the species.
```
           petal_width                                      
                count  mean   std  min  25%  50%  75%  max
species                                                  
setosa           50.0  0.24  0.11  0.1  0.2  0.2  0.3  0.6
versicolor       50.0  1.33  0.20  1.0  1.2  1.3  1.5  1.8
virginica        50.0  2.03  0.27  1.4  1.8  2.0  2.3  2.5
```
When it comes to petal width, it appears that setosa iris flowers have the narrowest petals, while virginica iris flowers have relatively wider petals compared to the other species.
However, descriptive statistics don't make inferences beyond the observed sample. If we want to make inferences about the three iris species beyond the measurements that [Anderson] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Anderson) took, we need to use statistical methods which will allow us to confidently generalise from a sample to a population. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is used to determine whether the means of two or more groups are significantly different from each other by examining the variation between groups compared to the variation within groups. I used a [linear OLS model](https://www.statsmodels.org/devel/anova.html) to do this. The results suggest that these observations we saw reach significance and we can therefore apply the observations from the sample to an actualc population.

## Machine Learning Models
### KNN Classifier

The iris dataset is often used to examine machine learning models so I decided to pick a relatively straightforward model to introduce myself to the field. The kNN algorithm is [relatively simple](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-simple-introduction-to-k-nearest-neighbors-algorithm-b3519ed98e) to implement so it seemed to be a good choice for an introduction to machine learning. It is a machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks - the [scikit-learn library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - provides a relatively straightforward implementation of the classifier.

The [algorithm](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/k-nearest-neighbor-classification-scikit-learn) works by comparing a new data point from a testing set to labeled data points in a training set. It determines the nearest neighbours based on a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance) and assigns the majority class among those neighbours to the new data point.This involved importing the necessary libraries, create an instance of the classifier, fitting the model with the training data, and making predictions on unseen data. I found that the accuracy of the model was 1.0.

## Conclusion
First, we discovered that the dataset comprises 150 samples, with 50 samples for each of the three Iris species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The mean values for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width were calculated for each species, revealing variations among the species.

Next, we visualized the data using scatter plots, histogram, and box plots to explore the relationships between different features and species. We observed a clear separation between setosa and the other two species in terms of petal length and petal width. Additionally, there appeared to be a positive correlation between petal length and petal width for all species. We also concluded that some of the data is normally distributed

Furthermore, we conducted statistical analysis, computing the mean, standard deviation, and correlation coefficients for the dataset. The correlations confirmed our visual observations, indicating strong positive correlations between petal length and petal width, as well as between sepal length and petal length.
This exploratory analysis serves as a foundation for further investigations and applications of the Iris dataset in various machine learning and data analysis tasks.

A key feature of the dataset to have emerged is the bimodal distribution of the petal length measurement. It is not immediately clear why the petal length measurement should be bimodal. Some researchers have hypothesized that this bimodality may be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors, while others have suggested that it may be an artifact of the data collection process. Regardless of the cause, this feature adds an extra layer of complexity to the analysis of the iris dataset and has spurred much discussion and debate in the machine learning community.

The KNN classifier was a mean of dipping our toes into a more interesting analysis - the accuracy of 1.0 shows that the predictions made by the model are 100% accurate, indicating that every single prediction made by the model matched our expectations perfectly.
