## Introduction
The Iris dataset is a commonly used dataset within machine learning and pattern recognition fields. It was introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936 as part of his research on multivariate statistics. The dataset consists of 150 observations of iris flowers, each with four measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The dataset is useful when exploring different machine learning algorithms, as it provides a means of comparing and evaluating the performance of different models. A task frequently cited in the literature is one that classifies the observations into one of three species of iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. The dataset is often used to assess the performace of different classification algorithms, including decision trees, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks.

OA strength of the dataset is that it is well-balanced, with an equal number of observations for each of the three species. Since the dataset is well-balances, it reduces the risk of bias towards one particular class. Additionally, the dataset is relatively small, which makes it easy to work with and analyse.

Another feature of the dataset is the bimodal distribution of the petal length measurement. It is not immediately clear why the petal length measurement should be bimodal. Some researchers have hypothesized that this bimodality may be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors, while others have suggested that it may be an artifact of the data collection process. Regardless of the cause, this feature adds an extra layer of complexity to the analysis of the iris dataset and has spurred much discussion and debate in the machine learning community.

*Libraries used*:
Numpy is used for performing mathematical operations and handling large arrays and matrices efficiently.

The Seaborn library focuses on data visualization. It extends the functionality of matplotlib and produces more visually appealing and informative plots.

Matplotlib.pyplot is a plotting library used to create static and interactive visualizations in Python.

Pandas is a library used for data manipulation and analysis - it provides data structures for efficiently storing and processing large datasets.

Scipy.stats provides functions for statistical analysis, including the shapiro, normaltest and norm functions used in this project.

numpy: NumPy is a Python library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, as well as a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on them. It is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python and is widely used in data analysis and machine learning applications.

seaborn: Seaborn is a Python library for data visualization based on matplotlib. It provides a higher-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn includes functions for making many common types of plots, such as scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps.

matplotlib.pyplot: Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python. pyplot is a sub-library of Matplotlib that provides a convenient interface for creating figures, subplots, and various types of plots, such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and histograms.

pandas: Pandas is a Python library that provides data structures for efficiently storing and manipulating large datasets. It is built on top of NumPy and provides additional functionality for working with structured data, including tools for reading and writing data to and from various file formats, data cleaning and transformation, and data analysis. Pandas is widely used in data science and machine learning applications.
